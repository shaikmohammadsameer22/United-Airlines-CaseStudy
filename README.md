‚úàÔ∏è United Airlines Flight Difficulty Dashboard

A Streamlit-based data analytics dashboard that calculates and visualizes the Flight Difficulty Score for United Airlines operations using real flight, passenger, and baggage data.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üß© Problem Statement

Frontline teams at United Airlines are responsible for ensuring every flight departs on time and is operationally ready.
However, not all flights are equally easy to manage ‚Äî some are more complex due to limited ground time, higher baggage load, or special passenger service requirements.

Currently, identifying high-difficulty flights relies on personal experience and local knowledge, leading to inconsistent and non-scalable decisions.

üéØ Objective

The goal is to design a data-driven framework that:

Calculates a Flight Difficulty Score for each flight using operational data

Identifies key drivers contributing to high-difficulty flights

Enables proactive planning and optimized resource allocation for on-ground teams
