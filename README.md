ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Frontline teams at United Airlines ensure every flight departs on time. However, not all flights are equally easy to manage â€” some flights are more complex due to:

Limited ground time

Higher baggage load or transfers

High passenger counts

Increased special service requests (SSR)

Currently, difficulty identification relies on local knowledge and manual judgment, which is inconsistent and non-scalable.

This project develops a data-driven Flight Difficulty Score to systematically quantify flight complexity and support proactive planning.
